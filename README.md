## Prodigy_Data-Science_Task-02

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Iris Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python code to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset as part of a data science internship task. The analysis includes data cleaning, correlation analysis, and data visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of various iris flowers. The dataset consists of 150 samples and 6 columns:

- Id: Unique identifier for each sample
- SepalLengthCm: Length of the sepal in centimeters
- SepalWidthCm: Width of the sepal in centimeters
- PetalLengthCm: Length of the petal in centimeters
- PetalWidthCm: Width of the petal in centimeters
- Species: Species of iris flower

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis includes the following steps:

- Data Cleaning: Checking for and handling any missing values in the dataset.
- Correlation Analysis: Calculating and visualizing the correlation between numerical features.
- Data Visualization: Creating various plots to explore the relationships between features and visualize the distribution of target classes.
